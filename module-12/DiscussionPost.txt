What I find most interesting about Python is how easy it is to create a new program and have it just work. For instance, my experience with APIs is based on DotNet. A DotNet API has hundreds of lines of code just for a single endpoint to function correctly. In Python, the small number of lines required to create an endpoint makes it quite manageable, making it easy to work with. 
	I found Django to be the most difficult to learn about. That is primarily because I do better starting with examples that I can experiment with and find the limits of. Django, on the other hand, is something that I had an issue getting my head around, mostly because I didn't have an easy example to start with and work from. Another reason I struggle to understand the point of Django is that I like to find similarities between different programming languages, and I have had issues doing so. The closest equivalent I could find online was ASP.NET MVC; even then, you are comparing apples to oranges.
	I want to explore API's in Python a bit more than I did. Most other languages make it somewhat complicated to interact with an API and to create one. The methods available in Python are more straightforward to use. I plan to determine whether adding authentication and authorization methods is easier or harder to implement in Python compared to, say, C#. In particular, how much work would it be to host a Python-made API in a cloud service compared to deploying a C# api into Azure?
